- Good, Clean Methods
    1. Goal - promote clean, readable, useful methods.
    2. Question - Are all of our methods good, clean, and readable?
    3. Proxy Measures
        - Must be less than 15 lines of code [Method Metric: Non-Comment Lines of Code] **NOTE: GUI methods are exempt**
        - Must take in <=5 parameters [Method Metric: Number of parameters]
        - Must have less than 6 nested block depth [Nested Block Depth] **NOTE: Event Listeners dynamically declared are exempt**
        - Must have a cyclomatic complexity must be <= 6 [Method Metric: Cyclomatic Complexity] **NOTE: GUI methods are exempt**
        - Must have lack of cohesion of methods <= 5 [Class Metric: Lack of Cohesion of Methods]
        - Must have at least 1 JavaDoc line per method + Another Line for each Parameter, Return, and Thrown Exception
        - Must have 90% Polymorphism Factor (http://www.aivosto.com/project/help/pm-oo-mood.html the higher the better)
        - Must not have more then 3 nested loops
    4. Action Plan - refactor if method doesn't meet requirements
    5. Collect Data - Use Intellij Metrics Reloaded Plugin
    6. Validate Proxy - http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/133404/what-is-the-ideal-length-of-a-method-for-you
    7. Change Your Behavior - Follow action plan. Repeat 5-7 until no more violations.
